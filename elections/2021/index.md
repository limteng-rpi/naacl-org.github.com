### [Jonathan May -- Treasurer](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/)

#### Bio

Jonathan May is a Research Assistant Professor in the Computer Science
Department of the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern
California, as well as a Research Lead with USC's Information Sciences
Institute, where he received a PhD in 2010. He has previously worked at BBN
Technologies and at Language Weaver (now SDL Research). His interests include
automata theory, machine translation, common-sense reasoning, semantic parsing,
and dialogue. He is currently treasurer of NAACL. Jon previously served as
workshop co-organizer and task organizer of SemEval from 2016 to 2019, handbook
chair for NAACL 2018, social media co-chair for NAACL in 2016, and local
arrangements co-chair for NAACL in 2010.

#### Candidacy Statement

Thank you for considering me for an additional term as NAACL treasurer. The past
two years have been fun and productive ones, as I’ve learned more about NAACL’s
financial health, implemented changes to improve efficiency, given advice to
mitigate risk while supporting interests critical to our community, and
weathered the current crisis. I look forward to building on the past term’s
learning experience and continuing to keep NAACL financially sound.

Apart from our annual conference, NAACL continues to support NACLO, to promote
CL/NLP awareness at the high school level. We provide scholarship funds for the
JSALT summer workshop series. And we sponsor initiatives in emerging regions of
the Americas via the ERF. As a member of the ERF committee, I am proud that we
have been able to maintain funding levels even in a time of uncertainty and have
sponsored worthwhile projects in Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and Colombia. And we have
innovated our sponsorship payment process to speed up international transactions
and reduce international exchange fees.

My goal for the coming term is to expand our support of these and other worthy
causes that promote the equitable expansion of research in natural language
processing and computational linguistics. Thanks to our hardworking ACL
treasurer David Yarowsky and ACL business manager Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL is
resolving long-standing uncertainties with regard to its financial health that
have necessitated caution in our spending. With these uncertainties resolved,
NAACL will be able to expand its support to increase NACLO, JSALT, and ERF
participation, which exposes as wide a population in the Americas as possible to
our field. When travel resumes, I will suggest we use available NAACL funds to
facilitate low-cost conference child support and provide conference travel
grants. In this way we will work toward ensuring that lack of money does not
equate to lack of access.

different roles in the ACL community. She has been a volunteer during
conferences, a reviewer since 2010, an area chair for dialogue and interactive
systems several times, and a member of the executive board of SIGDIAL and
SIGSEM.

#### Candidacy Statement

If I am elected as a member of the board my first natural goal will be to work
towards maintaining the high quality of the conference while I focus on
supporting diversity and inclusion. As a latinamerican researcher I know first
hand the serious problems that overlooking these issues provoke. I will aim to
boost diversity and inclusion at NAACL through the following initiatives:  

1. Care about ethics: I will propose to require the inclusion of an ethical
impact statement to all papers submitted to NAACL as it is now required by other
conferences in the field (e.g.,  Neurips). Such statements should not only
consider gender and race, but also take economy, power and climate into account.

2. Encourage reproducibility: I will explore incentives to encourage the release
of  implementation code, data, and trained models required to reproduce the
results of all papers submitted to NAACL. These measures would not only improve
transparency, but they would help researchers with low computing budgets
implement their ideas and even help reduce our carbon footprint.

3. Reward helpful members: I will propose the implementation of  a system of
“ACL karma points” for ACL members, that can be obtained by performing
activities that directly contribute to the NAACL community (e.g., writing good
reviews, volunteer roles at the conference, open sourcing materials, etc.).
Karma points could then be exchanged for concrete benefits like free ACL
membership or reduced conference registration fees.

4. Lower barriers: I will support ongoing, successful initiatives that already
strive to promote diversity and inclusion at NAACL.  In particular, I will
promote the continuation of the Widening NLP Workshop (WiNLP), and the Emerging
Regions Funds.  Moreover, during this year the organization of virtual
conferences has successfully increased participation of underrepresented
communities, and this format should be seriously considered in the future.

### [Steven Bethard](https://bethard.faculty.arizona.edu/)

#### Bio

Steven Bethard is an Associate Professor at the University of Arizona. He has
previously worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Stanford
University, Johns Hopkins University, KU Leuven, and the University of Colorado
Boulder, where he received his PhD in 2007. His research focuses on modeling the
language of time and timelines, normalizing text to medical and geospatial
ontologies, and information extraction models for clinical applications. He is
currently publications co-chair for NAACL 2021 and Vice-President Elect of
SIGLEX, and has previously served as co-chair of SemEval 2016-2018, publication
chair for ACL 2020 and EMNLP 2013, area chair for ACL 2015, 2016 and 2019, and
is a standing reviewer for TACL.

#### Candidacy Statement

Our already-growing community has had to rapidly adapt to the many challenges
presented by the COVID pandemic. As a board member, I would like to work on the
following initiatives:

* Explore new hybrid conference formats that allow both in-person and virtual
* attendance, not only to address the challenges of the COVID pandemic, but to
* address other challenges like reducing our carbon footprints. A key component
* of this initiative will be restoring some of the important social interactions
* that were not well maintained in the virtual conference formats of ACL 2020,
* etc. Simplify how NAACL proceedings are generated, taking advantage of the
* recent renovations of the ACL Anthology to generate proceeding directly in the
* new ACL Anthology format rather than through several layers of ACLPUB
* complexity. This would provide some needed flexibility, especially as we
* experiment with new conference formats, and would also make life easier for
* new workshop organizers and publication chairs. Support existing efforts in
* diversity, such as the WiNLP workshop, and look to how we might expand these
* efforts to even earlier in the pipeline, to attract a diverse set of students
* to apply to graduate schools in NLP. We might allocate funding to bring
* diverse undergraduate students to some portion of a NAACL conference, or
* design Jelinek Summer School (JSALT) style events with diversity as an
* explicit goal. Continue the ongoing work to adapt our reviewing systems to the
* increasing scale of our community, with a special eye towards reducing
* duplicate effort. I was pleased, for example, with how EMNLP 2020 was able to
* share rejected paper reviews with workshops to which those papers had been
* dual-submitted, and believe we should be doing more of this when it is
* feasible.

### [David Traum](http://people.ict.usc.edu/~traum/)

#### Bio

David Traum is the Director for Natural Language Research at the Institute for
Creative Technologies (ICT) and Research Professor in the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Southern California (USC). He leads the Natural
Language Dialogue Group at ICT. More information about the group can be found
here: http://nld.ict.usc.edu/group/ Traum earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science
at the University of Rochester in 1994.Traum’s research focuses on dialogue
communication between humans and artificial agents. He has engaged in
theoretical, implementational and empirical approaches to the problem, studying
human-human natural language and multi-modal dialogue, as well as building a
number of dialogue systems to communicate with human users. Traum has authored
over 250 refereed technical articles.

His research community service includes ACL 2019 Program Co-chair, SIGdial
leadership from 1998-2015 (vice president, president, president emeritus, and
board member), area chair for several NAACL and other \*ACL conferences, ACL Demo
Chair (1999), NAACL Workshops co-chair (2010), Associate editor for Dialogue and
Discourse Journal, and (co-)chair of over 30 smaller conferences and workshops.


#### Candidacy Statement

The CL/NLP field continues to change rapidly, with a rapidly increasing amount
of research output, many helpful tools, and massive industry presence affecting
many people every day. NAACL has been and will have to continue to adapt to
these changing conditions, supporting the current research community as well as
facilitating entry from new researchers and outreach to related communities and
the general public.

The global pandemic has caused major changes as with many aspects of life. A big
issue for NAACL will be how further the best aspects of in-person conferences
(such as in-depth and informal contacts), in an environment where large
in-person meetings is not possible, and conversely how to maintain and extend
the benefits of virtual participation, including lower cost, smaller
environmental footprint and fewer barriers to entry. This may be a good time to
rethink the relative benefits of conference vs journal publications, and whether
recent ACL reform proposals will most effectively and efficiently advance the
field and the careers of researchers. 

If elected, I would like to help NAACL navigate these and other issues,
continuing the experimentation with formats and policies, keeping what works to
achieve its objectives, moving on (or back where appropriate) when the
objectives are not met, or other problems emerge.

### [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com)

#### Bio

Graham Neubig is an associate professor at the Language Technologies Institute
of Carnegie Mellon University. His work focuses on natural language processing,
specifically multi-lingual models that work in many different languages, and
natural language interfaces that allow humans to communicate with computers in
their own language. Much of this work relies on machine learning, and he is also
active in developing methods and algorithms for machine learning over natural
language data. He publishes regularly in the top venues in natural language
processing, machine learning, and speech, and his work has won awards at EMNLP
2016, EACL 2017, and NAACL 2019. He has served on the NAACL board for the
2019-2020 term.

#### Candidacy Statement

I first ran for the NAACL board in 2018 on a platform of improving two things
regarding our conferences and publishing. The first was regarding remote
participation in conferences, with the goal of reducing the barrier of entry for
researchers who are not able to participating in conferences personally due to
financial or visa issues. The silver lining on the cloud of the COVID situation
is that it forced our hand on remote conferences, and I now believe that the
infrastructure is in place. If elected to a second term, I will advocate for
continuing to provide a comprehensive remote participation experience even after
we transition back to in-person conferences. The second issue was improvement of
our reviewing processes, with the goal of improving efficiency and reviewing
quality. I am continuing to advocate for this through participation in the ACL
reviewing committee, where I have developed software for reviewer-paper matching
(which has been used at ACL 2020 and EMNLP 2020), and also created proposals for
rolling review that are under consideration for the ACL as a whole. If elected,
I would like to use my position on the NAACL exec to continue advocating for
improvements in the reviewing processes for NAACL conferences and the ACL as a
whole.
